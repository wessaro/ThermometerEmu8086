# # # Problem Statement # # # 
This project includes an assembly program designed to read temperature values from a thermometer device and display them in both
Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. The program interacts with the thermometer device through specific ports and retrieves temperature
data. Subsequently, it stores the obtained temperature values in memory and reads new data at specific intervals.

# # # Program Workflow # # # 

1. Initialization:
The program initializes the data segment using the address 100h.
Sets the start address of the target data area to 1000h.

2. Temperature Reading:
Reads the temperature value from port 125 of the thermometer device.
Checks whether the read temperature value is negative or positive.

3. Negative Temperature Handling:
If the temperature value is negative, it is converted to a positive value by subtracting it from 255 and adding 1.
The negative sign "-" is printed along with the temperature value, and the temperature is displayed in Celsius format.

4. Positive Temperature Handling:
If the temperature value is positive, it is displayed in Celsius format.

5. Fahrenheit Conversion:
Converts the Celsius temperature value to Fahrenheit.
The result is displayed on the screen and stored in memory.

6. Memory Management:
The program stores the temperature data starting from the address 1000h to 100Bh.
If the 12th data point matches the current data, the program returns to the starting point and overwrites previous data.

7. Delay:
A delay function is used to control the timing of data acquisition.
The delay duration is specified in the cx register.

# # # Usage # # # 

1.Compilation: Compile the provided assembly code using an appropriate assembler (e.g., MASM or NASM).

2.Execution: After successful compilation, run the executable file generated by the assembler. Ensure that the program is executed 
on a compatible system with the required hardware interfaces for input/output operations.

# # # Dependencies # # # 

Hardware: The program interacts with a thermometer device through specific input/output ports.

Assembler: An assembler compatible with the assembly language used in the code is required for compilation.

# # # Customization # # #

Number of Data Points: You can customize the number of data points to be stored by modifying the appropriate part of the code.

Delay Adjustment: Change the value in the cx register to adjust the delay in the data reading interval.

Port Addresses: If the port addresses for input/output operations differ for your hardware, update the respective values in the code.

# # # Notes # # # 
Ensure that the hardware interfaces (ports) used in the program are available and accessible on the system where the program is executed.
Carefully review and modify the code as needed to suit your specific hardware configuration and requirements.
